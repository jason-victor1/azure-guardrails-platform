# Azure Governance & Guardrails Platform

This repo implements an **Azure governance and guardrails platform** focused on **identity-first security, policy-as-code, and secure-by-default Azure foundations**.

This project demonstrates how to design, enforce, and operate **Azure platform controls**—including **management group hierarchy, RBAC and Privileged Identity Management (PIM), and Azure Policy initiatives**—to prevent misconfiguration and reduce risk at scale.
